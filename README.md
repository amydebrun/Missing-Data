All the works are contained in the **workflows** folder here.

In case you want to examine how certain things work. Our analyses are conducted in either one or several R scripts in the "R scripts" folder. The code will be sourced, and the results  printed out in the "Missing_Value_Analysis.Rmd" file. These plots and tables are then saved in .RData files, which are imported into "Final_Report.Rmd".

**Document** 

**1. Final_Report.Rmd** 
  - This is the .rmd file used to produce the final report
  - Contains all the writings

**2. Missing_Value_Analysis.Rmd**
