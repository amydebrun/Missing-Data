	abstract = {Multiple imputation ({MI}) and full information maximum likelihood ({FIML}) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, {MI} and {FIML} are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with {MI}, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before {MI} and {FIML} are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. {MI} theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test {MI} models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using {MI} should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient.

	abstract = {Following the seminal publications of Rubin about thirty years ago, statisticians have become increasingly aware of the inadequacy of “complete-case” analysis of datasets with missing observations. In medicine, for example, observations may be missing in a sporadic way for different covariates, and a complete-case analysis may omit as many as half of the available cases. Hotdeck imputation was implemented in Stata in 1999 by Mander and Clayton. However, this technique may perform poorly when many rows of data have at least one missing value. This article describes an implementation for Stata of the {MICE} method of multiple multivariate imputation described by van Buuren, Boshuizen, and Knook (1999). {MICE} stands for multivariate imputation by chained equations. The basic idea of data analysis with multiple imputation is to create a small number (e.g., 5–10) of copies of the data, each of which has the missing values suitably imputed, and analyze each complete dataset independently. Estimates of parameters of interest are averaged across the copies to give a single estimate. Standard errors are computed according to the “Rubin rules”, devised to allow for the between- and within-imputation components of variation in the parameter estimates. This article describes five ado-files. mvis creates multiple multivariate imputations. uvis imputes missing values for a single variable as a function of several covariates, each with complete data. micombine fits a wide variety of regression models to a multiply imputed dataset, combining the estimates using Rubin's rules, and supports survival analysis models (stcox and streg), categorical data models, generalized linear models, and more. Finally, misplit and mijoin are utilities to intercon-vert datasets created by mvis and by the miset program from John Carlin and colleagues. The use of the routines is illustrated with an example of prognostic modeling in breast cancer.},

In this paper, we examine different approaches to imputing transformed variables; and we find one simple method that works well across a variety of circumstances.

	abstract = {Multiple imputation ({MI}) and full information maximum likelihood ({FIML}) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, {MI} and {FIML} are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with {MI}, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before {MI} and {FIML} are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. {MI} theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test {MI} models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using {MI} should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to {FIML}) due to using too few imputations.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review was to establish the frequency with which trials take into account missingness, and to discover what methods trialists use for adjustment in randomised controlled trials with longitudinal measurements. Failing to address the problems that can arise from missing outcome data can result in misleading conclusions. Missing data should be addressed as a means of a sensitivity analysis of the complete case analysis results. One hundred publications of randomised controlled trials with longitudinal measurements were selected randomly from trial publications from the years 2005 to 2012. Information was extracted from these trials, including whether reasons for dropout were reported, what methods were used for handing the missing data, whether there was any explanation of the methods for missing data handling, and whether a statistician was involved in the analysis. The main focus of the review was on missing data post dropout rather than missing interim data. Of all the papers in the study, 9 (9\%) had no missing data. More than half of the papers included in the study failed to make any attempt to explain the reasons for their choice of missing data handling method. Of the papers with clear missing data handling methods, 44 papers (50\%) used adequate methods of missing data handling, whereas 30 (34\%) of the papers used missing data methods which may not have been appropriate. In the remaining 17 papers (19\%), it was difficult to assess the validity of the methods used. An imputation method was used in 18 papers (20\%). Multiple imputation methods were introduced in 1987 and are an efficient way of accounting for missing data in general, and yet only 4 papers used these methods. Out of the 18 papers which used imputation, only 7 displayed the results as a sensitivity analysis of the complete case analysis results. 61\% of the papers that used an imputation explained the reasons for their chosen method. Just under a third of the papers made no reference to reasons for missing outcome data. There was little consistency in reporting of missing data within longitudinal trials.},

	abstract = {Missingness mechanism is in theory unverifiable based only on observed data. If there is a suspicion of missing not at random, researchers often perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of various missingness mechanisms. In general, sensitivity analysis approaches require a full specification of the relationship between missing values and missingness probabilities. Such relationship can be specified based on a selection model, a pattern-mixture model or a shared parameter model. Under the selection modeling framework, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach using a nonparametric multiple imputation strategy. The proposed approach only requires specifying the correlation coefficient between missing values and selection (response) probabilities under a selection model. The correlation coefficient is a standardized measure and can be used as a natural sensitivity analysis parameter. The sensitivity analysis involves multiple imputations of missing values, yet the sensitivity parameter is only used to select imputing/donor sets. Hence, the proposed approach might be more robust against misspecifications of the sensitivity parameter. For illustration, the proposed approach is applied to incomplete measurements of level of preoperative Hemoglobin A1c, for patients who had high-grade carotid artery stenosisa and were scheduled for surgery. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.},

Previous work has shown that covariate-stratified effect estimates from complete-case analysis are unbiased when missingness is independent of the outcome conditional on the exposure and covariates. Here, we assess the bias of complete-case analysis for adjusted marginal effects when confounding is present under various causal structures of missing data. We show that estimation of the marginal risk difference requires an unbiased estimate of the unconditional joint distribution of confounders and any other covariates required for conditional independence of missingness and outcome. The dependence of missing data on these covariates must be considered to obtain a valid estimate of the covariate distribution. If none of these covariates are effect-measure modifiers on the absolute scale, however, the marginal risk difference will equal the stratified risk differences and the complete-case analysis will be unbiased when the stratified effect estimates are unbiased. Estimation of unbiased marginal effects in complete-case analysis therefore requires close consideration of causal structure and effect-measure modification.},

	abstract = {Objectives The purpose of the study was to provide empirical evidence about the reporting of methodology to address missing outcome data and the acknowledgement of their impact in Cochrane systematic reviews in the mental health field. Methods Systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews after January 1, 2009 by three Cochrane Review Groups relating to mental health were included. Results One hundred ninety systematic reviews were considered. Missing outcome data were present in at least one included study in 175 systematic reviews. Of these 175 systematic reviews, 147 (84\%) accounted for missing outcome data by considering a relevant primary or secondary outcome (e.g., dropout). Missing outcome data implications were reported only in 61 (35\%) systematic reviews and primarily in the discussion section by commenting on the amount of the missing outcome data. One hundred forty eligible meta-analyses with missing data were scrutinized. Seventy-nine (56\%) of them had studies with total dropout rate between 10 and 30\%. One hundred nine (78\%) meta-analyses reported to have performed intention-to-treat analysis by including trials with imputed outcome data. Sensitivity analysis for incomplete outcome data was implemented in less than 20\% of the meta-analyses. Conclusions Reporting of the techniques for handling missing outcome data and their implications in the findings of the systematic reviews are suboptimal. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Pharmacoepidemiologic multi‐database studies ({MDBS}) provide opportunities to better evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medicines. However, the issue of missing data is often exacerbated in {MDBS}, potentially resulting in bias and precision loss. We sought to measure how missing data are being recorded and addressed in pharmacoepidemiologic {MDBS}.

Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in {PubMed} for pharmacoepidemiologic {MDBS} published between 1st January 2018 and 31st December 2019. Included studies were those that used ≥2 distinct databases to assess the same safety/effectiveness outcome associated with a drug exposure. Outcome variables extracted from the studies included strategies to execute a {MDBS}, reporting of missing data (type, bias evaluation) and the methods used to account for missing data.

Results
Two thousand seven hundred and twenty‐six articles were identified, and 62 studies were included: using data from either North America (56\%), Europe (31\%), multiple regions (11\%) or East‐Asia (2\%). Thirty‐five (56\%) articles reported missing data: 11 of these studies reported that this could have introduced bias and 19 studies reported a method to address missing data. Thirteen (68\%) carried out a complete case analysis, 2 (11\%) applied multiple imputation, 2 (11\%) used both methods, 1 (5\%) used mean imputation and 1 (5\%) substituted information from a similar variable.

Conclusions
Just over half of the recent pharmacoepidemiologic {MDBS} reported missing data and two‐thirds of these studies reported how they accounted for it. We should increase our vigilance for database completeness in {MDBS} by reporting and addressing the missing data that could introduce bias.},
