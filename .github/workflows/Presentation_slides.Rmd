# Recapitulation

## Missing Data

Missing data is defined as data that has not been stored for a variable
in the observation of interest. A systematic review of articles
regarding 62 studies found that:

-   44% did not report missing data
-   69% did not report how missing data was handled

This shows how missing data is a topic that is often neglected even
though it can cause biased results when handled inappropriately.

## Missingness Mechanisms

-   Missing Completely At Random: $$P(R = 1 \mid Y, X) = P(R = 1)$$
-   Missing At Random: $$P(R = 1 \mid Y, X) = P(R = 1 \mid X)$$
-   Missing Not At Random: $$P(R = 1 \mid Y, X) \ne P(R = 1 \mid X)$$
-   We can never confirm these assumptions but Little's MCAR Test can
    rule out the MCAR assumption

# Approaches to Missing Data

## Complete Case Analysis

-   Only analyse the cases where there are no missing data in any
    variables, this is popular due to its swift application.
-   Cases with missing data are ignored

Limitations:

-   May be valid when data is MCAR only
-   Introduces selection bias
-   Reduces statistical power

## Single Imputation

-   Replaces missing data with a single value
-   Last observation carried forward: the missing value is replaced by
    the preceding observed measure,
-   Mean observation carried forward: the missing value is replaced by
    the mean value of all observed measure.

Limitations:

-   Reduces variability in the results
-   Assumes data is MCAR

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   Linear Mixed Effects Model adjusts to missing data by using maximum
    likelihood estimation
-   It uses all observed data to measure the treatment effect without
    needing to use complete cases only.
-   This is suitable for when the outcome variable has NA values
-   Suitable for MAR and MCAR

## Multiple Imputation Using Chained Equations

-   All missing data are imputed with values derived from observed data
    to act as placeholders
-   Starting with variable $x_i$ that contains missing data, remove the
    place holders in this variable
-   Regress $x_i$ on remaining covariates $x_{i+1}$, $x_{i+2}$,...,
    $x_{i+p}$
-   $x_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i+1} + \beta_2 x_{i+2} + ...+\beta_p x_{i+p} + \varepsilon$
-   This model is predicts the missing values in $x_i$ if it were
    observed, these steps are repeated for $x_{i+1}$, $x_{i+2}$,...,
    $x_{i+p}$
-   We can use this process to create $m$ data sets with imputed values,
    typically 5 or 10 suffices.

## Sensitivity Analysis

This estimates the treatment effect when data is analysed under
different missingness assumptions. The $δ-Adjustment$ approach shows how
the treatment effect changes when the data is missing not at random.

## Estimating Treatment Effects

-   Simple Linear Regression Models: Outcome is modelled as a straight
    line
-   Linear Mixed Effects Models: Extends the linear regression model by
    accounting for individual variability

We use use both types of modelling on the different types of imputed
data sets to see how the treatment effect estimates change.

## Treatment Effect of Acupuncture

When treating time as continuous:

Estimand: Difference in mean headache score $pk_score$ at final time
point of 12 months

Linear Regression Model:
$\small\text{pk_score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group} + \beta_2  \text{time} + \beta_3  (\text{group}  \text{time}) + \beta_4  \text{pk1} + \varepsilon$

Linear Mixed Effects model:
$\small\text{pk_score}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group}_i + \beta_2  \text{time}_{ij} + \beta_3 (\text{group}_i  \text{time}_{ij}) + \beta_4 \text{pk1}_i + b_{0i} + \varepsilon_{ij}$

## Treatment Effect of Acupuncture

Treating time as categorical

Estimand: Mean difference in headache score $pk5$

Linear Regression Model:
$\small\text{pk5} = \beta_0 + \beta_1  \text{group} + \beta_2 \text{pk1} + \varepsilon$

Linear Mixed Effects:
$\small\text{pk5}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1  \text{group}_i + \beta_2 \text{pk1}_i + \beta_3  \text{pk2}_{ij} + b_{0i} + \varepsilon_{ij}$

For simplicity, only group and baseline outcome are included as covariates.

1. Combination of different parameters  
   - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) or Linear Mixed Effects (LME)  
   - Different imputation methods  

2. Changing estimands  

3. Different multiple imputation methods  

4. Sensitivity analysis (delta shift method)

```{r layout="two-columns"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
acu_plot_categorical
```

$\small \text{pk5} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group} + \beta_2 \text{pk1} + \varepsilon$

$\small \text{pk5}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group}_i + \beta_2 \text{pk2}_{ij} + b_{0i} + \varepsilon_{ij}$

## Combination of Different Parameters – VITAL Result

```{r layout="two-columns"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
vital_plot_categorical
```

$\small \text{pain\_yr4} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group} + \beta_2 \text{pain\_baseline} + \varepsilon$

$\small \text{pain\_yr4}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group}_i + \beta_2 \text{pain\_baseline}_{ij} + b_{0i} + \varepsilon_{ij}$

## Changing Estimands – Summary

In the previous session, the estimand was:  
**Mean difference in outcome at the end of the study** between groups.

$\small \text{outcome\_end} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group} + \beta_2 \text{outcome\_baseline} + \varepsilon$

Now we test an alternative estimand:  
**Difference in the rate of outcome change over time** between groups.

$\small \text{outcome\_end} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{group} + \beta_2 \text{outcome\_baseline} + \beta_3 \text{time} + \varepsilon$

## Changing Estimands – Result

```{r layout="two-columns"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

## Conclusion

So far, for both datasets, no significant impact has been observed across different missing data analysis methods.

Note: At this stage, we have not included covariates yet. This may not make much difference for the acupuncture dataset, since there are no missing values in those covariates.

However, the VITAL dataset contains missing values in several covariates to varying extents and includes more frequent data collection time points. Therefore, we expect to see greater variation across methods in that dataset.
